# Repository: bootcamp

In this repository you’ll find the slides and code that we went over during our introduction to Java and programming bootcamp. You may want to refer to the information in these as you progress throughout the robotics competition. Together the slides and examples provide a **very basic** introduction to Java, but enough to get you started.

In the directory for each day you will find the PowerPoint files for the day and any Java code we discussed.
